        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h4>AirGarage was founded in 2017 when Chelsea, Scott, and Jonathon stumbled upon the inefficiencies in the parking industry while searching for cheaper university parking.</h4>
        <h4>When our first partners told us of their problems, we learned just how outdated the entire industry was. They were dealing with gate arms and ticket machines that broke, parking attendants who would skim off the cash earning, and little to no data insights being collected at all.</h4>
        <h4>We knew we could build a system how it should be today-- one that is completely online and automated.</h4>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <h4>We envision a future in which parking lots in our cities can be seen for the valuable real estate they are and be utilized for their highest and best use.</h4>
        <h4 id="dark">AirGarage is building an API for interfacing with the legacy real estate infrastructure in cities.</h4>
        <h4>This could range from supporting future distribution and charging logistics for Autonomous Vehicles to empowering small pop-up shop entrepreneurs to providing on-demand warehouse space to enable faster delivery of essentials to consumers.</h4>
        <h4>Doing so will foster innovation and entrepreneurship in our cities, developing them into more vibrant and dynamic places for all people. If that mission excites you, join us.</h4>
